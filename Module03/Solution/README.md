## Question 1 - What are the needed Nouns

- Animal 
- Companion 
- Trick
- Menagerie
- Taxonomy

Note, there is a logical argument for Companion to be specific animals, but the problem with that argument as every time a new animal companion type is added a new class needs to be added. It is not a scalable solution, but it can fit depending on the scope of the project.

There is also an argument for Animal to be something more like "Resident" or "Creature". This really is more of an issue with language and how we interpret the problem. Someone could be looking as Menagerie to be a magical menagerie for a story or game - and question where would you put a Trent, as it is plant based and not an animal. However, based on the problem statement, it made more sense to use animal in this case and not obfuscate the problem with a more general term.
