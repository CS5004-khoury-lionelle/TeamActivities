# Module 04 Team Activity - Equality, Hashing, and Collections Framework

For this activity, we are going look at the purpose of .equal and .hashCode methods in Java. We will also look at the Collections Framework in Java, specifically in the context of collections that need .equals and .hashCode methods for them to work effectively. 

Additionally, to further your understanding of Java, we will cover in more detail on how to read and write files. 

## Grading
Grades for team activities will be based on attendance and notes. You must attend, and as a team you need to generate notes that we can confirm your work. Ideally, you upload the notes as a PDF to the team meeting after you build them out. 

> [!TIP] 
> Good notes become a study guide for you and your team! Make sure they include everything you need to help better understand the weekly material. 

### ‚≠ê Working in Teams ‚≠ê
When working in teams, remember do not let one person do all the work. Make sure to work together, and ask questions. It is also better if different people program, and you all take turns programming for various team assignments.

## Learning Objectives
This team activity is designed to help you understand the following concepts:
* How to properly implement .equals and .hashCode methods in Java
* Describe the Set and Map interfaces in Java
* How to use the HashSet and HashMap  in Java, along how they work with Steams.
* Be able to read and write to a  File in using Java

## Equality in Java

To better understand equality in java, it is worth discussing the difference between a primitive and an object. 

* Primitive types are the basic data types in Java, such as int, char, double, and boolean. Another way to look at them is they are types that can represented by a single number in memory. 
* Objects are complex data types that are made up of multiple primitive types or objects. In memory, they are often represented by a reference to a memory location. 

Let's take the following java code as an example:

```java
class Person {
  private String name;
  public Person(String theName) {
    this.name = theName;
  }
}

public class Student extends Person {
  private int id;
  public Student(String theName, int id) {
    super(theName);
    this.id = id;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int value = 10;
    Person e1 = new Student("Alice", 1);
    Person e2 = new Student("Bob", 2);
    Person e3 = new Student("Carol", 3);
    Person arrayOfPeople[] = {e1, e2, e3};
    
    Person e4 = new Student("Alice", 1); // same as e1?
    
    System.out.println(e1 == arrayOfPeople[0]); // what is printed here?
    System.out.println(e1 == e4); // what is printed here?
  }
}
```

Using the PythonTutor (which also happens to allow java visualizations, though a bit buggy and limited) you may have used in 5001, we are able to generate the following visualization of the code above:

 Where ever there is an arrow, there is actually a memory address. 

 ### üëâüèΩ Discussion
 Looking at both the memory diagrams, and the code - what do you think will be printed when the code is run? Why? 


### Implementing .equals in Java

In general, the `==` sign can only truly compare primitives or memory addresses because they compare what is exactly on the stack frame at that moment. For objects, what is on the stack frame is actually the memory address of the object. To overcome that limitation, every Object in java has both a `.equals` and `.hashCode` method. They don't do anything special or different by default, but they can be overridden to provide a more meaningful comparison.

For example, if we wanted a student with the Name and ID to be equal to another student with the same name and ID, we could override the `.equals` method in the Student class. 


:fire: Task: Implement the `.equals` method in the Student class.  Use the two templates provided. [Person.java](Person.java) and [Student.java](Student.java). Notice the main
changed some from the above example, so you can better test your results.  While using `instanceof` is *alright* can you think of how you would do it using reflection? 




### Implementing .hashCode in Java

The `.hashCode` method is used to generate a unique hash code (`int` value) for an object. This is used in conjunction with the `.equals` method to determine if two objects are equal. Why not just equals? There are multiple algorithms such as a hashing algorithm that requires an int representation of an object. By having .hashCode, we can use the int representation to quickly determine if two objects are equal along with other benefits. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is standard practice to always override the `.hashCode` method when you override the `.equals` method, 
> as not having them equivalency between the two causes unusual errors when dealing with built in java collections.
> These two methods along with .toString() are the most common methods to override in any
> new class you create.
>
> Always, if your .equals method returns true when comparing two objects, 
> your .hashCode method should return the same value for the two objects. 


:fire: Task: Implement the `.hashCode` method in the Student class.  Use the two templates provided. [Person.java](Person.java) and [Student.java](Student.java).

The most common way to implement the `.hashCode` method is to use the `Objects.hash` method. This method takes in a variable number of arguments and returns a hash code based on the values of the arguments. 

```java

@Override
public int hashCode() {
  return Objects.hash(name, id);
}
```

Notice that ID is a int, and name is a string. That is fine. What it does is take the hashCode of Integer(id), and the hashCode of String(name) and combines them.  You could attempt to generate a unique identifier for the student on your own, such as doing the following

```java

@Override
public int hashCode() {
  int hash = id;
  for (int i = 0; i < name.length(); i++) {
    hash += name.charAt(i);
  }
  return hash;
}
```

But then you may find some objects are equivalent that are not. For example, in the above code, the following two students end up returning the same hash code:

```java
Student s1 = new Student("jan", 1);
Student s2 = new Student("anj", 1);
```

As all the characters are the same even if they are in a different order. This is called a "Collision". In practice they are unavoidable, but the more unique the hash code, the less likely they are to occur. A topic you may further explore in CS 5008.


> [!NOTE]
> In industry is very common to use a ready made class that handles equality and hashCode for you. These class are called [EqualsBuilder](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/builder/EqualsBuilder.html) and [HashCodeBuilder](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/builder/HashCodeBuilder.html). They are part of the Apache Commons Lang library. You can see an example [here](https://www.codeproject.com/articles/143431/apache-commons-equalsbuilder-and-hashcodebuilder).
>
> Starting with Homework 05, you can OPTIONALLY use the [Apache Commons Lang Library](https://commons.apache.org/) classes in your code as we have included the commons-lang3 library in the project.

## Sets in Java

In mathematics a set contains a collection of unique elements. This was also used in python using the 'Set' data structure. In Java, the `Set` interface is used to represent a collection of unique elements. The `Set` interface is implemented by the `HashSet` class.

As such, to create a new set, you can do the following:

```java
Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
```

üëâüèΩ Discussion - Without fully knowing the code, discuss as a group what you can tell from the code. For example: What type are you storing in the set? What is the interface? What is the actual class?


### :fire: Practice!

You will fine [SetPractice.java](SetPractice.java) in the repository. This contains a main method so you can practice with sets. 

1. Take a look at the provided code, discuss what it does. 
2. Add to the code an set that uses Person, with both Person and Student objects. Provide some examples including what happens when you try to add a duplicate. For example, the constructors looked like the following:
  ```java
    Person p1 = new Person("Alice");
    Person p2 = new Student("Alice", 1);
    Person p3 = new Student("Alice", 2);
    Person p4 = new Student("Alice", 1); // same as p2?
  ```

What happens when you add p4 to the set? Is it working the same way when you add Strings? Why or why not? (if not, double check your equal and hashCode methods)  


## Maps in Java

In python, a set was related to a dictionary. The dictionary would take key:value pairs, but all keys had to be unique. As such, the collection of keys was a set.  In java, this is very similar, but instead of calling it a dictionary, we call it a `Map`. The `Map` interface is used to represent a collection of key-value pairs. The `Map` interface is implemented by the `HashMap` class. 

As such, to create a new map, you can do the following:

```java
Map<String, Double> map = new HashMap<>();

map.put("Apple", 2.99);
map.put("Banana", 1.99);
```


üëâüèΩ Discussion - Without fully knowing the code, discuss as a group what you can tell from the code.  Additionally, what do you think will happen if we attempt to do a `map.put("Apple", 1.99)`?
