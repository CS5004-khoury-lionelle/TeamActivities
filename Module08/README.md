# Module 07 Team Activity  - MVC: Controller



## Grading
Grades for team activities will be based on attendance and notes. You must attend, and as a team you need to generate notes that we can confirm your work. Ideally, you upload the notes as a PDF to the team meeting after you build them out.

## :fire: Java Practice Problem
As part of **every** team activity, we will ask you to work on a Java Practice problem, and submit the code to the team files section (or as part of your notes).

Remember, to learn a new language, the best thing you can do is practice! Here are some resources to find practice problems but you are not limited to them:
